#Why Geany
The tutorials for the Traffichat based in python can come in two variants targeted to people who either use Idle or Geany to code them in.

If you've not heard of Geany, Geany is a basic Integrated Development Environment which is also open source.
It features some basics the same as Idle such as running the code with a click of a button, syntax highlighting and auto-completiton but also is slightly more featured in my view.

Here's a quick Pro & Cons table of my views from using it in teaching.

###Benefits of using Geany
* Setup correctly it can run python programs using sudo while not having to launch geany as sudo. Ideal for school networks with induvidual user accounts.
* Can have multiple programs / files open in different tabs
* Each time code is run in a completely new terminal.


###Downsides of using Geany
* Requires installation
* Doesn't require previously ran program to be exited / killed before running the next.


#How to install Geany
Installing Geany is very simple.

1. First make sure your Pi is connected to the internet
2. Open up an terminal (Menu --> Accessories --> Terminal)
3. Type in ```sudo apt-get install geany```

#How to install Geany - PiNET / Pi_ltsp
Installing Geany on Pi_ltsp is even simpler.

1. Connect to the server and launch the administration utility
